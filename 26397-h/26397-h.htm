<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the present subject of discussion
tempts to many an excursion into particulars,
its treatment is restricted to general
outlines, with an aim simply to clarify
current ideas of miracle and the supernatural,
so as to find firm holding ground
for tenable positions in the present "drift
period" of theology. The chief exception
made to this general treatment is the discussion
given to a class of miracles regarded
with as much incredulity as any,
yet as capable as any of being accredited
as probably historical events&mdash;the raisings
of the "dead." The insistence of some
writers on the virgin birth and corporeal
resurrection of Jesus as essential to Christianity
has required brief discussion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
these also, mainly with reference to the
reasonableness of that demand. As to the
latter miracle, it must be observed that in
the Biblical narratives taken as a whole,
whichever of their discordant features one
be disposed to emphasize, the psychical
element clearly preponderates over the
physical and material.</p>

<img src="images/008.png" width="75" height="75" alt="I" title="" />
</div><p class="p3"><span class="dcap">n</span> a historical retrospect greater
and more revolutionary changes
are seen to have occurred during
the nineteenth century than in any
century preceding. In these changes no
department of thought and activity has
failed to share, and theological thought
has been quite as much affected as scientific
or ethical. Especially remarkable is
the changed front of Christian theologians
toward miracles, their distinctly lowered
estimate of the significance of miracle,
their antipodal reverse of the long established
treatment of miracles. Referring
to this a British evangelical writer<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> observes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that "the intelligent believer of
our own day, ... instead of accepting
Christianity on the ground of the miracles,
accepts it in spite of the miracles.
Whether he admits these miracles, or
rejects them, his attitude toward them
is toward difficulties, not helps."</p>

<p>By this diametrical change of Christian
thought a great amount of scepticism has
already been antiquated. A once famous
anti-Christian book, <i>Supernatural Religion</i>,
regarded as formidable thirty years
ago, is now as much out of date for relevancy
to present theological conditions as
is the old smooth-bore cannon for naval
warfare. That many, indeed, are still
unaware of the change that has been
experienced by the leaders of Christian
thought, no one acquainted with current
discussions will deny; the fact is indubitable.
It is reviewed in the following
pages with the constructive purpose of redeeming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the idea of supernatural Religion
from pernicious perversion, and of exhibiting
it in its true spiritual significance. The
once highly reputed calculations made to
show how the earth's diurnal revolution
could be imperceptibly stopped for Joshua's
convenience, and the contention that the
Mediterranean produced fish with gullets
capable of giving passage to Jonah, are
now as dead as the chemical controversy
about phlogiston. Yet some sceptical
controversialists are still so far from cultivating
the acquaintance with recent
thought which they recommend to Christian
theologians, as to persist in affirmations
of amazing ignorance, <i>e.g.</i> "It is admitted
that miracles alone can attest the
reality of divine revelation."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Sponsors
for this statement must now be sought
among unlearned Christians, or among a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
few scholars who survive as cultivators
of the old-fashioned argument from the
"evidences." Even among these latter
the tendency to minimize miracle is undeniably
apparent in a reduction of the
list classified as such, and still more in
the brevity of the list insisted on for the
attestation of Christianity.</p>

<p>A transitional state of mind is clearly
evidenced by the present division and
perplexity of Christian thought concerning
the Christian miracles. Many seem
to regard further discussion as profitless,
and are ready to shelve the subject. But
this attitude of weariness is also transitional.
There must be some thoroughfare
to firm ground and clear vision. It
must be found in agreement, first of all,
on the real meaning of a term so variously
and vaguely used as <i>miracle</i>. In
the present imperfect state of knowledge
it may be impossible to enucleate miracle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
however defined, of all mystery. But
even so will much be gained for clear
thinking, if miracle can be reasonably
related to the greater mystery which all
accept, though none understand,&mdash;the
mystery of <i>life</i>. This view of the dynamic
relation of life to miracle<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is here
suggested for what it may prove to be
worth.</p>

<p>The great and general change that
transfigured theology during the nineteenth
century was characteristically
ethical. This, indeed, is the distinctive
feature of the so-called new theology, in
contrast with that which the Protestant
Reformers inherited from St. Augustine.
God and Man, Faith, Salvation and Inspiration,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Redemption and Atonement,
Judgment and Retribution,&mdash;all these
themes are now presented in orthodox
pulpits far more conformably to ethical
principles, though in degrees varying
with educated intelligence, than was customary
in the sermons of half a century
ago. "One great source and spring
of theological progress," says Professor
Bowne, in his recent work on <i>Theism</i>,
"has been the need of finding a conception
of God which the moral nature
could accept. The necessity of moralizing
theology has produced vast changes
in that field; and the end is not yet."</p>

<p>The ethical character of the theological
change will perhaps be most
obvious in the field of Biblical study,
to which the present subject belongs.
The traditional solution of such moral
difficulties in the Old Testament as
commands, ostensibly divine, to massacre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
idolaters has been quite discarded.
It is no longer the mode to say that
deeds seemingly atrocious were not atrocious,
because God commanded them.
Writers of orthodox repute now say that
the <i>Thus saith the Lord</i>, with which
Samuel prefaced his order to exterminate
the Amalekites, must be understood
subjectively, as an expression of
the prophet's belief, not objectively, as
a divine command communicated to him.
This great change is a quite recent
change. If a personal reference may be
indulged, it is not twenty years since the
present writer's published protest against
"The Anti-Christian Use of the Bible in
the Sunday School,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the exhibition to
children of some vestiges of heathen
superstition embedded in the Old Testament
narratives as true illustrations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
God's ways toward men, drew forth from
a religious journal a bitter editorial on
"The Old Testament and its New Enemies."
But a great light has since
dawned in that quarter. It is no longer
deemed subversive of faith in a divine
Revelation to hold that the prophet
Gad was not infallible in regarding the
plague which scourged Jerusalem as sent
to punish David's pride in his census of
the nation.</p>

<p>A significant fact is presented in the
comparison of these two aspects of the
theological change that has come to pass,&mdash;the
growing importance of the ethical,
and the dwindling importance of the
miraculous in the religious thought of
to-day. This may reassure those who
fear whereto such change may grow.
The inner significance of such a change
is most auspicious. It portends the displacement
of a false by the true conception<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of supernatural Religion, and the
removal thereby of a serious antagonism
between Science and Christian Theology,
as well as of a serious hindrance of many
thoughtful minds from an intelligent embrace
of Christianity.</p>

<div class="bq1"><p><span class="smcap">Synopsis.</span>&mdash;The gradual narrowing of the miraculous
element in the Bible by recent discovery and
discussion.&mdash;The alarm thereby excited in the
Church.&mdash;The fallacy which generates the fear.&mdash;The
atheistic conception of nature which generates
the fallacy.&mdash;The present outgrowing of this
conception.</p></div>

<div class="figcp">
<img src="images/008.png" width="75" height="75" alt="I" title="" />
</div><p class="p3"><span class="dcap">t</span> is barely forty years since that
beloved and fearless Christian
scholar, Dean Stanley, spoke
thus of the miracles recorded of the
prophet Elisha: "His works stand alone
in the Bible in their likeness to the acts
of medi&aelig;val saints. There alone in the
Sacred History the gulf between Biblical
and Ecclesiastical miracles almost disappears."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It required some courage to say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as much as this then, while the storm
of persecution was raging against Bishop
Colenso for his critical work on the Pentateuch.
The evangelical clergymen in
England and the United States then prepared
to confess as much as this, with all
that it obviously implies, could have been
seated in a small room. But time has
moved on, and the Church, at least the
scholars of the Church, have moved with it.
No scholar of more than narrowly local
repute now hesitates to acknowledge the
presence of a legendary element both in
the Old Testament and in the New. While
the extent of it is still undetermined, many
specimens of it are recognized. It is agreed
that the early narratives in Genesis are of
this character, and that it is marked in
such stories as those of Samson, Elijah,
and Elisha. Even the conservative revisers
of the Authorized Version have
eliminated from the Fourth Gospel the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
story of the angel at the pool of Bethesda,
and in their marginal notes on the Third
Gospel have admitted a doubt concerning
the historicity of the angel and the bloody
sweat in Gethsemane.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some events, recognized as
historical, have been divested of the miraculous
character once attributed to them,&mdash;the
crossing of the Red Sea, for instance,
by the Hebrew host. A landslip
in the thirteenth century <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> has been
noted as giving historical character to the
story of the Hebrew host under Joshua's
command crossing the Jordan "on dry
ground," but in a perfectly natural way.
Other classes of phenomena once regarded
as miraculous have been transferred to the
domain of natural processes by the investigations
and discoveries that have been
made in the field of psychical research.
The forewarning which God is said to have
given the prophet Ahijah of the visit that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the queen was about to pay him in disguise<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
is now recognized as one of many
cases of the mysterious natural function
that we label as "telepathy." The transformations
of unruly, vicious, and mentally
disordered characters by hypnotic influence
that have been effected at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re
in Paris, and elsewhere, by physicians expert
in psychical therapeutics are closely
analogous to the cures wrought by Jesus
on some victims of "demoniac possession."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The cases of apparition,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> also, which have
been investigated and verified by the Society
for Psychical Research have laid a solid
basis of fact for the Biblical stories of angels,
as at least, a class of phenomena to
be regarded as by no means altogether
legendary, but having their place among
natural though mysterious occurrences.</p>

<p>But this progressive paring down of the
miraculous element in the Bible has caused
outcries of unfeigned alarm. Christian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
scholars who have taken part in it are reproached
as deserters to the camp of unbelief.
They are accused of banishing God
from his world, and of reducing the course
of events to an order of agencies quite
undivine. "Miracle," writes one of these
brethren,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> "is the personal intervention of
God into the chain of cause and effect."
But what does this mean, except that, when
no miracles occur, God is not personally,
<i>i.e.</i> actively, in the chain of natural causes
and effects? As Professor Drummond
says, "If God appears periodically, he disappears
periodically." It is precisely this
view of the subject that really banishes
God from his world. Those who thus define
miracle regard miracles as having
ceased at the end of the Apostolic age in
the first century. Except, therefore, for the
narrow range of human history that the Bible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
covers in time and place, God has not been
personally in the chain of natural causes
and effects. Thus close to an atheistic conception
of nature does zeal for traditional
orthodoxy unwittingly but really come.</p>

<p>The first pages of the Bible correct this
error. "While the earth remaineth," so
God is represented as assuring Noah, "seedtime
and harvest, and cold and heat, and
summer and winter, and day and night,
shall not cease." The presence of God in
his world was thus to be evinced by his
regular sustentation of its natural order,
rather than by irregular occurrences, such
as the deluge, in seeming contravention of
it. To seek the evidence of divine activity
in human affairs and to ground one's
faith in a controlling Providence in sporadic
and cometary phenomena, rather than
in the constant and cumulative signs of it
to be seen in the majestic order of the
starry skies, in the reign of intelligence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
throughout the cosmos, in the moral evolution
of ancient savagery into modern
philanthropy, in the historic manifestation
throughout the centuries of a Power not
our own that works for the increase of
righteousness, is a mode of thought which
in our time is being steadily and surely
outgrown. It is one of those "idols of the
tribe" whose power alike over civilized
and uncivilized men is broken less by argument
than by the ascent of man to wider
horizons of knowledge.</p>

<p>It is for the gain of religion that it
should be broken,&mdash;of the spiritual religion
whose God is not a tradition, a reminiscence,
but a living presence, inhabiting alike
the clod and the star, the flower in the crannied
wall and the life of man. So thinking
of God the religious man may rightly say,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
"If it is more difficult to believe in miracles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
it is less important. If the extraordinary
manifestations of God recounted in ancient
history appear less credible, the ordinary
manifestations of God in current life appear
more real. He is seen in American
history not less than in Hebrew history;
in the life of to-day not less than in the
life of long ago."</p>

</div><p class="p3"><span class="dcap">he</span> cultivation of scientific and
historical studies during the last
century, especially in its latter
half, has deepened the conviction that</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;">
<span class="i0">"Through the ages one increasing purpose runs;"<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">has disposed a growing number of
thoughtful minds to regard occasional
signs and wonders, reported from ancient
times, as far less evidential for the reasonableness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of religious faith than the steady
sustentation of the Providential order and
the moral progress of the world. Fully
convinced of this, we should now estimate,
before proceeding further, the present net
results of the discussion, so far as it has
gone, of what is called the miraculous
element in the Bible.</p>

<p>First, its former evidential value in
proof of divine Revelation is gone for
the men of to-day. The believer in a
divine Revelation does not now, if he is
wise, rest his case at all on the miracles
connected with its original promulgation,
as was the fashion not very long since.
This for two reasons; chiefly this: that
<i>the decisive criterion of any truth, ethical
or physical, must be truth of the same
kind</i>. Ethical truth must be ethically
attested. The moral and religious character
of the Revelation presents its credentials
of worth in its history of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
moral and religious renovations it has
wrought both in individuals and in
society. This is its proper and incontrovertible
attestation, in need of no
corroboration from whatever wonderful
physical occurrences may have accompanied
its first utterance. Words of
God are attested as such by the work
of God which they effect. It may well
be believed that those wonderful occurrences&mdash;the
Biblical name for which is
"signs," or "powers," terms not carrying,
like "miracles," the idea of something
contra-natural<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;had an evidential
value for those to whom the Revelation
originally came. In fact, they were appealed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to by the bearers of the Revelation
as evidencing its divine origin by
the mighty works of divine mercy which
they wrought for sufferers from the evils
of the world. But whatever their evidential
value to the eye-witnesses at that
remote day, it was of the inevitably volatile
kind that exhales away like a perfume
with lapse of time. Historic doubts
attack remote events, especially when of
the extraordinary character which tempts
the narrator to that magnifying of the
marvellous which experience has found
to be a constantly recurring human trait.
It is simply impossible that the original
evidential value of the "signs" accompanying
the Revelation should continue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
permanently unimpaired. To employ them
now as "evidences of Christianity," when
the Revelation has won on ethical grounds
recognition of its divine character and can
summon history to bear witness of its
divine effects in the moral uplift of the
world, is to imperil the Christian argument
by the preposterous logical blunder
of attempting to prove the more certain
by the less certain.</p>

<p>A second net result consequent on the
preceding may be described as the transference
of miracles from the ordnance
department to the quartermaster's department
of the Church. Until recently they
were actively used as part of its armament,
none of which could be dispensed
with. Now they are carried as part of
its baggage, <i>impedimenta</i>, from which
everything superfluous must be removed.
It is clearly seen that to retain all is to
imperil the whole. That there are miracles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and miracles is patent to minds
that have learned to scan history more
critically than when a scholar like John
Milton began his <i>History of England</i>
with the legend of the voyage of "Brute
the Trojan." One may reasonably believe
that Jesus healed a case of violent
insanity at Gadara, and reasonably disbelieve
that the fire of heaven was twice
obedient to Elijah's call to consume the
military companies sent to arrest him.
Cultivated discernment does not now put
all Biblical miracles on a common level
of credibility, any more than the historical
work of Herodotus and that of
the late Dr. Gardiner. To defend them
all is not to vindicate, but to discredit all
alike. The elimination of the indefensible,
the setting aside of the legendary,
the transference of the supposedly miraculous
to the order of natural powers
and processes so far as vindicable ground<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
for such critical treatment is discovered,
is the only way to answer the first of
all questions concerning the Bible: How
much of this is credible history? Thus
it is not only thoroughly reasonable, but
is in the interest of a reasonable belief
that divine agency is revealed rather by
the upholding of the established order
of Nature than by any alleged interference
therewith. With what God has
established God never interferes. To
allege his interference with his established
order is virtually to deny his constant
immanence therein, a failure to
recognize the fundamental fact that "Nature
is Spirit," as Principal Fairbairn has
said, and all its processes and powers
the various modes of the energizing of
the divine Will.</p>

<p>A third net result now highly probable
is a still further reduction of the list of
reputed miracles. The critical process of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
discriminating the historical from the legendary,
and the natural from the non-natural,
is still so comparatively recent
that it can hardly be supposed to have
reached its limit. Nor can it be stayed
by any impeachment of it as hostile to
Christianity, whose grand argument appeals
to its present ethical effects, not to ancient
thaumaturgical accompaniments. There
is, however, a considerable class of cases
in which the advancing critical process
is likely even to gain credibility for the
Biblical narrative in a point where it is
now widely doubted&mdash;the resuscitations
of the apparently dead. Among all the
Biblical miracles none have more probably
a secure historical basis.</p>

recorded,&mdash;three in the Old
Testament and four in the New. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
critics arbitrarily reject all but one of these
as legendary. Thus Oscar Holzmann, in
his recent <i>Leben Jesu</i>, treats the raising
of the widow's son, and of Lazarus. But
he accepts the case of the ruler's daughter
on the ground that Jesus is reported as
saying that it was not a case of real but
only of apparent death,&mdash;"the child is
not dead, but sleepeth." But for the preservation
of this saving declaration in the
record, this case also would have been
classed with the others as unhistorical.
And yet the admission of one clear case
of simulated death, so like real death as
to deceive all the onlookers but Jesus,
might reasonably check the critic with
the suggestion that it may not have been
a solitary case.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The headlong assumption<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
involved in the discrimination made
between these two classes, viz. that in a
case of apparent but unreal death the
primitive tradition can be depended on
to put the fact upon record, is in the
highest degree arbitrary and unwarrantable.</p>

<p>The scepticism which lightly contradicts
the Biblical narratives of the raising of the
"dead" to life is seemingly ignorant of
facts that go far to place these upon firm
ground as historical occurrences. Catalepsy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
or the simulation of death by a
trance, in which the body is sometimes
cold and rigid, sensation gone, the heart
still, is well known to medical men.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In
early times such a condition would inevitably
have been regarded and treated as
actual death, without the least suspicion
that it was not so. Even now, the dreadful
mistake of so regarding it sometimes
occurs. So cautious a journal as the
London <i>Spectator</i> a few years ago expressed
the belief that "a distinct percentage"
of premature burials "occurs
every year" in England.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>The proper line of critical approach to
the study of the Biblical narratives of the
raising of the "dead" is through the well-known
facts of the deathlike trance and
premature burial.</p>

<p>Where burial occurred, as in the East,
immediately after the apparent death,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> resuscitation
must have been rare. Yet
cases of it were not unknown. Pliny has
a chapter "on those who have revived
on being carried forth for burial." Lord
Bacon states that of this there have been
"very many cases." A French writer of
the eighteenth century, Bruhier, in his
"<i>Dissertations sur l'Incertitude de la
Mort et l'Abus des Enterrements</i>," records
seventy-two cases of mistaken pronouncement
of death, fifty-three of revival in the
coffin before burial, and fifty-four of burial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
alive. A locally famous and thoroughly
attested case in this country is that of the
Rev. William Tennent, pastor in Freehold,
New Jersey, in the eighteenth century,
who lay apparently dead for three days,
reviving from trance just as his delayed
funeral was about to proceed. One who
keeps a scrap-book could easily collect
quite an assortment of such cases, and of
such others as have a tragic ending, both
from domestic and foreign journals. A
work published some years ago by Dr.
F. Hartmann<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> exhibits one hundred and
eight cases as typical among over seven
hundred that have been authenticated.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p><p>Facts like these have been strangely overlooked
in the hasty judgment prompted
by prejudice against whatever has obtained
credence as miraculous. Some
significant considerations must be seriously
entertained.</p>

<p>It cannot be that no such facts occurred
in the long periods covered by the Biblical
writers. Occurring, it is extremely improbable
that they should have altogether
escaped embodiment in popular tradition
and its record. Furthermore, while on
one hand the custom of speedy burial
rendered them much rarer than they are
now under other conditions, and so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the more extraordinary, the universal ignorance
of the causes involved would
have accepted resuscitation as veritable
restoration from actual death. As such
it would have passed into tradition. In
cases where it had come to pass in connection
with the efforts of a recognized
prophet, or through any contact with him,
it would certainly have been regarded as
a genuine miracle.</p>

<p>Among the raisings of the "dead" recorded
in the Scriptures probably none
has been so widely doubted by critical
readers as the story in the thirteenth chapter
of the second book of Kings, in which a
corpse is restored to life by contact with
the bones of Elisha. Dean Stanley's remark
upon the suspicious similarity between
the miracles related of Elisha and
those found in Roman Catholic legends
of great saints here seems quite pertinent.
Let the record speak for itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="bq2"><p>"And Elisha died and they buried him.
Now the bands of the Moabites invaded
the land at the coming in of the year.
And it came to pass, as they were burying
a man, that, behold, they spied a band;
and they cast the man into the sepulchre of
Elisha; and as soon as the man touched
the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood
up on his feet."</p></div>

<p>The bizarre character of such a story
excusably predisposes many a critic to
stamp it as fabricated to enhance the
glory of the great prophet who had been
a pillar of the throne. Yet nothing is
more likely than that tradition has here
preserved a bit of history, extraordinary,
but real. There is not the least improbability
in regarding the case as one of the
many revivals from the deathlike trance
that have been noted by writers ancient
and modern. It is entirely reasonable to
suppose that the trance in which the seemingly
dead man lay was broken either by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the shock of his fall into the prophet's
tomb, or coincidently therewith; and
stranger coincidences have happened.
Such a happening would be precisely
the sort of thing to live in popular tradition,
and to be incorporated into the
annals of the time.</p>

<p>Here it may be rejoined that this is
only a hypothesis. Only that, to be sure.
But so is the allegation that the story is
a mere fantastic fabrication only a hypothesis.
Demonstration of the actual
fact past all controversy being out of
the question, all that can be offered for
the attempt to rate the narrative at its
proper value, either as history or as fiction,
is hypothesis. The choice lies for us
between two hypotheses. Surely, that
hypothesis is the more credible which is
based on a solid body of objective facts,
and meets all the conditions of the case.</p>

<p>Will it be replied to this that the critics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
can show for their hypothesis the admitted
fact of the human proclivity to
invent legends of miracle? The decisive
answer is that the burden of proof rests
on him who contests any statement ostensibly
historical. If such a statement
be found to square with admitted objective
facts, it must be accepted notwithstanding
considerations drawn from the subjective
tendency to invent extraordinary tales.</p>

<p>Were raisings of the "dead" recorded
in the Old Testament alone, objection
would less often be offered to this transference
of them, along with other occurrences
once deemed miraculous, to a place
in the natural order of things. The statistics
of premature burial and of the
resuscitation of the apparently dead before
burial are sufficiently strong to throw
grave doubt on any contention that the
resuscitations narrated of Elijah<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Elisha<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> do not belong in that historical
series. It has been frequently observed,
however, that there is much reluctance to
apply to the New Testament the methods
and canons of criticism that are applied
to the Old. It will be so in the present
case, through apprehension of somehow
detracting from the distinctive glory of
Christ. That fear will not disturb one
who sees that glory not in his "mighty
works," the like of which were wrought
by the prophets, but in the spiritual majesty
of his personality, the divineness of his
message to the world, and of the life and
death that illustrated it.</p>

<p>One case, at least, among Jesus' raisings
of the "dead," that of the young
daughter of the ruler of the synagogue,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
is admitted even by sceptical critics to
have been a resuscitation from the trance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that merely simulates death. But the fact
that there is a record of his saying in
this case, "the child is not dead, but
sleepeth," and no record of his saying
the same at the bier of the widow's son,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
is slight ground, yet all the ground there
is, against the great probabilities to the
contrary, for regarding the latter case as
so transcendently different from the former
as the actual re&euml;mbodiment of a departed
spirit recalled from another world. Were
these the only two cases of restoration
to life in the ministry of Jesus, it is most
probable that they would be regarded as
of the same kind.</p>

<p>The raising of Lazarus<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> presents peculiar
features, in view of which it is generally
regarded as of another kind, and
the greatest of miracles, so stupendous
that the Rev. W. J. Dawson, in his recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<i>Life of Christ</i>, written from an evangelical
standpoint, says of it: "Even the
most devout mind may be forgiven occasional
pangs of incredulity." But the
considerations already presented are certainly
sufficient to justify a re&euml;xamination
of the case. And it is to be borne in
mind that the question at issue is, not
what the eye-witnesses at that time believed,
not what the Church from that
time to this has believed, not what we
are willing to believe, or would like to
believe, but what all the facts with any
bearing on the case, taken together, fully
justify us in believing as to the real nature
of it.</p>

<p>What Jesus is recorded as saying of
it is, of course, of prime importance.
"Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep, but
I go that I may awake him out of sleep."
Were this all, the case might easily have
been classed as one of trance. The disciples,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
however, understood Jesus to speak
of natural sleep. "Then Jesus therefore
said unto them plainly, <i>Lazarus is dead</i>."
Tradition puts the maximum meaning
into this word "dead." But if this word
here qualifies the preceding word, "fallen
asleep," so also is it qualified by that;
the two are mutually explanatory, not
contradictory. These alternatives are before
us: Is the maximum or the minimum
meaning to be assigned to the crucial
word "dead"? For the minimum, one
can say that a deathly trance, already
made virtual death by immediate interment,
would amply justify Jesus in using
the word "dead" in order to impress the
disciples with the gravity of the case, as
not a natural but a deathly, and, in the
existing situation, a fatal sleep. For the
maximum, no more can be advanced than
the hazardous assertion that Jesus <i>must</i>
have used the word with technical precision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in its customary sense; an assertion
of course protected from disproof
by our ignorance of the actual fact.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
whatever support this view of the case
derives from such ignorance is overbalanced
by the support supplied to the
other view by the long history of revivals
from the deathly trance, and by the probabilities
which that history creates.</p>

<p>Many, to whom the view here proposed
seems not only new, but unwelcome, and
even revolutionary, may reasonably prefer
to suspend judgment for reflection;
but meanwhile some further considerations
may be entertained.</p>

<p>1. Aside from the unwillingness to abandon
a long-cherished belief on any subject
whatever, which is both a natural,
and, when not pushed to an unreasonable
length, a desirable brake on all
inconsiderate change, no practical interest
is threatened by the adoption of the
view here suggested. Religious interest,
so far as it is also intelligent, is certainly
not threatened. The evidences of Jesus'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
divine character and mission resting, as
for modern men it rests, not on remote
wonders, but on now acknowledged facts
of an ethical and spiritual kind, is altogether
independent of our conclusion
whether it was from actual or only apparent
death that Lazarus was raised.
Since all the mighty works wrought by
Jesus, and this among them, were identical
in type with those wrought by the
ancient prophets, with whom his countrymen
classed him in his lifetime, their
evidential significance could be, even
for the eye-witnesses at that tomb, no
greater for him than for an Elisha,&mdash;signs
of a divine mission attesting itself
by works of mercy.</p>

<p>2. As works of mercy these raisings
from the "dead," including that of
Lazarus, rank far higher in the view of
them here proposed than in the traditional
view. This regards them as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
recall of departed spirits from what is
hoped to be "a better world." Yet this,
while it turns sorrow for a time into joy,
involves not only the recurrence of that
sorrow in all its keenness, but also a
second tasting of the pains preliminary
to the death-gate, when the time comes
to pass that gate again. But in the
other view, a raising from the death that
is only simulated is a merciful deliverance
from a calamity greater than simple
death, if that be any calamity at all,&mdash;the
fate of burial alive. In the former
view, therefore, the quality of mercy,
distinctive of the mighty works of Jesus,
is imperfectly demonstrable. In the present
view, as the rescue of the living from
death in one of its most horrible forms,
it is abundantly conspicuous.</p>

<p>3. The onlookers by the tomb of Lazarus
doubtless regarded his awakening as
revival from actual death. Their opinion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
however, does not bind our judgment
any more than it is bound by the opinion
of other onlookers, that Jesus' healing of
the insane and epileptic was through the
expulsion of demons that possessed them.
In each instance it was understood as a
sign of control over beings belonging to
another world. But such an attestation
of Jesus' divine mission, having been superseded
for us by proofs of higher
character, is now no more needful for
us in the case of the "dead" than in
the case of the "demons."</p>

<p>4. The power of breaking the deathly
trance, of quickening the dormant life,
re&euml;nergizing the collapsed nervous organism,
and ending its paralysis of sensation
and motion, may be reasonably regarded
as power of the same psychical
kind that Jesus regularly exerted in healing
the sufferers from nervous disorders
who were reputed victims of demoniac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
possession.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In this view these resuscitations
from apparent death appear in
natural coherence with the many other
works of mercy that Jesus wrought as
the Great Physician of his people, and
may be regarded as the crown and consummation
of all his restorative ministries.
Jesus' thanksgiving after the tomb
had been opened&mdash;"Father, I thank
thee that thou hast heard me"&mdash;shows
that he had girded himself for a supreme
effort by concentrating the utmost
energy of his spirit in prayer. Physically
parallel with this was the intensity of
voice put into his call to the occupant
of the tomb. This is better represented
in the original than in our translation:
"He shouted with a great voice, 'Lazarus,
come forth.'" The whole record
indicates the utmost tension of all his
energies, and closely comports with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
view that this stood to the sequel in the
relation of cause to effect.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Another circumstance
not without bearing on the
case is the energizing power of the intense
sympathy with the bereaved family
that stirred the soul of Jesus to weep
and groan with them. And it is not
without significance that this strong factor
appears active in the larger number
of the Biblical cases,&mdash;three of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
only children, two of these the children
of the pitiable class of widows.</p>

<p>Peculiar, then, as was the case of Lazarus,
our examination of it reveals no substantial
ground for insisting that it was
essentially unlike the previous case of the
ruler's daughter, that it was the bringing
back into a decaying body of a spirit that
had entered into the world of departed
souls. The actual fact, of course, is indemonstrable.
Our conclusion has to be
formed wholly upon the probabilities of
the case, and must be formed in a reasonable
choice between the greater probability
and the less.</p>

<p>The restoration of Dorcas to life by
Peter, recorded in the book of Acts,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> needs
no special discussion beyond the various
considerations already adduced in this
chapter. The case of Eutychus, recorded
in the same book,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> requires mention only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
lest it should seem to have been forgotten,
as it is not in point at all. The record
makes it highly probable that the supposed
death was nothing more than the
loss of consciousness for a few hours in
consequence of a fall from the window.</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>If one should here suggest that no mention
has yet been made of the resurrection
of Jesus himself, it must be pointed out
that this is a fact of a totally different
kind from any of the foregoing cases. To
speak, as many do, of the "resurrection of
Lazarus" is a misuse of words. Resuscitation
to life in this world, and resurrection,
the rising up of the released spirit
into the life of the world to come, are as
distinct as are the worlds to which they
severally belong. We here consider only
the <i>raisings</i> which restored to the virtually
dead their interrupted mortal life. The
<i>rising</i> from the mortal into the immortal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
state belongs to an entirely different field
of study.</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>Apart, then, from traditional prepossessions,
examination of the Biblical narratives
discloses nothing to invalidate the hypothesis
which one who is acquainted with the
copious record of apparent but unreal
death must seriously and impartially consider.
The reputedly miraculous raisings
of the "dead" related in both the Old and
the New Testament may, with entire reason,
and without detriment to religion, be
classed with such as are related outside of
the Scriptures, in ancient times as well as
modern, and as phenomena wholly within
the natural order, however extraordinary.
The practical result of such a conclusion is
likely to be a gain for the historicity of the
Scripture narratives in the estimate of a
large class of thoughtful minds.</p>

narrator of the raising of Lazarus. But he omits
notice of the two raisings recorded by the other

whose silence on this point cannot be pressed
as conclusive. It is, indeed, unlikely that Jesus
knew all that medical men now know. But
awareness of any fact may be in varying degrees
from serious suspicion up to positive certitude.
While far from positiveness, awareness
may exist in a degree that gives courage for
resolute effort resulting in clear and full verification.
Jesus may have been ignorant of the

by the divine aid he prayed for (John xi. 41)

approach a clearer understanding
of the proper meaning to
attach to the generally ill-defined and hazy
term <i>miracle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Matthew Arnold's fantastic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
illustration of the idea of miracle by supposing
a pen changed to a pen-wiper may
fit some miracles, especially those of the
Catholic hagiology, but, if applied to those
of Jesus, would be a caricature. In the
New Testament a reputed miracle is not
any sort of wonderful work upon any sort
of occasion, but an act of benevolent will
exerted for an immediate benefit,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and
transcending the then existing range of
human intelligence to explain and power
to achieve. The historic reality of at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
some such acts performed by Jesus is
acknowledged by critics as free from the
faintest trace of orthodox bias as Keim:
"The picture of Jesus, the worker of miracles,
belongs to the first believers in Christ,
and is no invention."</p>

<p>It has already been noted that a considerable
number of the then reputed miracles
of Jesus, particularly his works of healing,
do not now, as then, transcend the
existing range of knowledge and power,
and accordingly are no longer reputed
miraculous. And one cannot reasonably
believe that a limit to the understanding
and control of forces in Nature and mind
that now are more or less occult has been
already reached. It is, therefore, not incredible
that some of the mighty works
of Jesus, which still transcend the existing
limits of knowledge and power, and so are
still reputed miraculous, and are suspected
by many as unhistorical, may in some yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
remote and riper stage of humanity be
transferred, as some have already been,
to the class of the non-miraculous and
natural.</p>

<p>Dr. Robbins, Dean of the General Theological
Seminary, New York, after remarking
that "the word <i>miracle</i> has done
more to introduce confusion into Christian
Evidences than any other," goes on
to say: "To animals certain events to
them inexplicable are signs of the presence
of human intelligence and power.
To men these miracles of Christ are signs
of divine intelligence and power. But
how is miracle to be differentiated from
other providential dealings of God? Not
by removing him further from common
events. Abstruse speculations concerning
the relation of miracles to other
physical phenomena may be safely left
to the adjustment of an age which shall
have advanced to a more perfect synthesis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of knowledge than the present can
boast."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The truth to which such considerations
conduct is, that no hard and fast line can
be drawn between the miraculous and the
non-miraculous. To the untutored mind,
like that of the savage who thought it
miraculous that a chip with a message
written on it had talked to the recipient,
the simplest thing that he cannot explain
is miraculous: "<i>omne ignotum pro mirifico</i>,"
said Tacitus. As the range of
knowledge and power widens, the range
of the miraculous narrows correspondingly.
Some twenty years since, the International
Sunday-school Lessons employed as a
proof of the divinity of Christ the reputedly
miraculous knowledge which he evinced
in his first interview with Nathanael of
a solitary hour in Nathanael's experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Since then it has been demonstrated<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> by
psychical research that the natural order
of the world includes telepathy, and the
range of the miraculous has been correspondingly
reduced without detriment to
the argument for the divinity of Christ,
now rested on less precarious ground.</p>

<p>Under such conditions as we have reviewed
a miracle cannot always be one
and the same thing. Miracle must therefore
be defined as being what our whole
course of thought has suggested that it is:
in general, an elastic word; in particular,
a provisional word,&mdash;a word whose application
narrows with the enlarging range of
human knowledge<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and power which for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the time it transcends; a word whose
history, in its record of ranges already
transcended, prompts expectation that
ranges still beyond may be transcended
in the illimitable progress of mankind.
Professor Le Conte says that miracle is
"an occurrence or a phenomenon according
to a law higher than any yet known."
Thus it is a case of human ignorance, not
of divine interference.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we must believe that
the goal of progress is a flying goal; that
human attainment can never reach finality
unless men cease to be. And so all widening
of human knowledge and power must
ever disclose further limitations to be
transcended. There will always be a
<i>Beyond</i>, in which dwells the secret of laws
still undiscovered, that underlie mysteries
unrevealed and marvels unexplained.
This will have to be admitted, especially,
by those to whom the marvellous is synonymous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
with the incredible. We have not
been able to eviscerate even these prosaic
and matter-of-fact modern times of marvels
whose secret lies in the yet uncatalogued
or indefinable powers of the mysterious
agent that we name <i>life</i>: witness many
well verified facts recorded by the Society
for Psychical Research.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> How, then, is it
consistent to affirm that no such marvels
in ancient records are historical realities?
Nay, may it not be true that the ancient
days of seers and prophets, the days of
Jesus, days of the sublime strivings of
great and lonely souls for closer converse
with the Infinite Spirit behind his mask of
Nature, offered better conditions for marvellous
experiences and deeds than these
days of scientific laboratories and factories,
and world-markets and world-politics?</p>

</div><p class="p3"><span class="dcap">e</span> it noted, now, that the marvellous
phenomena of the Biblical
record, whatever else be
thought of them, are, even to a superficial
view, the extraordinary effluence of extraordinary
lives. Here at length we gain
a clearer conception of miracle. <i>Life</i> is the
world's great magician,&mdash;life, so familiar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
yet so mysterious; so commonplace, yet so
transcendent. No miracle is more marvellous
than its doings witnessed in the
biological laboratory, or more inexplicable
than its transformation of dead matter into
living flesh, its development of a Shakespeare
from a microscopic bit of protoplasm.
But its mysterious processes are
too common for general marvel; we marvel
only at the uncommon. The boy
Zerah Colburn in half a minute solved the
problem, "How many seconds since the
beginning of the Christian era?" We
prefer to call this a prodigy rather than a
miracle,&mdash;a distinction more verbal than
real; and we fancy we have explained it
when we say that such arithmetical power
was a peculiar endowment of his mental
life. Now all of the inexplicable, inimitable
reality that at any time has to be left
by the baffled intellect as an unsolved
wonder under the name of miracle is just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that,&mdash;<i>the natural product of an extraordinary
endowment of life</i>. More of its marvellous
capability is latent in common
men, in the subconscious depths of being,
than has ever yet flashed forth in the
career of uncommon men. Some scientists
say that it depends on chemical and
physical forces. It indeed uses these to
build the various bodies it inhabits, but
again it leaves these to destroy those bodies
when it quits them. The most constant
and ubiquitous phenomenon in the
world, the ultimate reality in the universe,
is <i>life</i>, revealing its presence in innumerable
modes of activity, from the dance of
atoms in the rock to the philosophizing of
the sage and the aspirations of the saint,&mdash;the
creator of Nature, the administrator
of the regular processes we call the
laws of Nature, the author of the wonders
men call miraculous because they are
uncommon and ill understood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The works of which any man is naturally
capable are conditioned by the psychical
quality of his life, and its power to use
the forces of Nature. Through differences
of vital endowment some can use color,
as wonderful painters, and others employ
sound, as wonderful musicians, in ways impossible
to those otherwise endowed. So
"a poet is born, not made." So persons of
feeble frame, stimulated by disease or
frenzied by passion, have put forth preternatural
and prodigious muscular strength.
By what we call "clairvoyant" power life
calls up in intelligent perception things
going on far beyond ocular vision. By
what we call "telepathic" power life
communicates intelligence with life separated
by miles of space. Such are some of
the powers that have been discovered, and
fully attested, but not explained, as belonging
to the world's master magician,
<i>Life</i>. And when the poet asks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;">
<span class="i5">"Ah, what will our children be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men of a hundred thousand, a million summers away?"<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">we can only answer with the Apostle: "It
doth not yet appear what we shall be."
But we cannot deem it likely that the
powers of life,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;">
<span class="i0">"Deep seated in our mystic frame,"<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">and giving forth such flashes of their inherent
virtue, have already reached their
ultimate development.</p>

<p>We look with wonder and awe into the
secret shrine of life, where two scarcely
visible cells unite to form the human being
whose thought shall arrange the starry
heavens in majestic order, and harness the
titanic energies of Nature for the world's
work. There we behold the real supernatural.
Nothing is more natural than
life, and nothing also more supernatural.
Biology studies all the various forms
that the world shows of it, and affirms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that life, though multiform, is one.
This embryology attests, showing that
the whole ascent of life through diverse
forms from the lowest to the highest, during
the millions of years since life first
manifested its presence on this globe, is
recapitulated in the stages of growth
through which the human being passes in
the few months before its birth. And philosophy,
which does not seek the living
among the dead, affirms, <i>omne vivum
ex vivo</i>. The varied but unitary life of the
world is the stream of an exhaustless
spring. It is filial to the life of God, the
Father Almighty. What the ancient
creed affirmed of the Christ as the Son of
God&mdash;whom his beloved disciple recognized
as "the eternal life which was with
the Father and was manifested unto us<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>"&mdash;may
be truly affirmed of the mysterious reality
that is known as life: "Begotten not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
made; being of one substance with the
Father; through whom [or which] all
things were made." Looking from the
derived and finite life of the world, visible
only in the signs of its presence, but in its
reality no more visible than him "whom
no man hath seen, nor can see," up to the
life underived, aboriginal, infinite, we recognize
<i>God</i> and <i>Life</i> as terms of identical
significance. How superficial the notion
of miracles as "the personal intervention
of God into the chain of cause and effect,"
in which he is the constant vital element.
If an event deemed miraculous is ever ascribed,
as of old, to "the finger of God," the
reality behind the phenomenon is simply a
higher or a stronger power of life than is
recognized in an event of a common type&mdash;life
that is one with the infinite and universal
Life,</p>

</div><p class="p3"><span class="dcap">he</span> present line of thought has
now reached the point where
an important question confronts
us,&mdash;a question not wholly new. Within
the memory of living men theologians
have been compelled to ask themselves:
What if the geologists should establish
facts that contradict our Biblically derived
doctrine that the universe was made
in a week? Again have they been constrained
to put to themselves the question:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
What if the evolutionists should supersede
our doctrine that the creation is the
immediate product of successive fiats of
the Creator by showing that it came
gradually into existence through the progressive
operation of forces immanent in
the cosmos? Still again have they had to
face the question: What if modern criticism
by the discovery of demonstrable
errors in the Sacred Writings should fault
our doctrine that, as the Word of God,
the Bible is free from all and every
error? In every instance the dreaded
concession, when found at length to be
enforced by modern learning, has been
found to bring, not the loss that had
been apprehended, but clear gain to the
intellectual interests of religion. Now it
is this same sort of question which returns
with the uncertainties and difficulties
widely felt in the Church to be gathering
over its hitherto unvexed belief in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
miracles as signs of a divine activity more
immediate than it has recognized in the
regular processes of Nature.</p>

<p>The majority of uneducated Christians
still hold, as formerly in each of the
points just mentioned, to the traditional
view. Miracle as a divine intervention
in the natural order, a more close and
direct divine contact with the course of
things than is the case in ordinary experience,
they regard as the inseparable and
necessary concomitant and proof of a
divine Revelation. To deny miracles,
thus understood, is censured as equivalent
to denial of the reality of the Revelation.
But it is rather surprising, because
it is rare, to find a man of such note in
literature as Dr. W. Robertson Nicoll
affirming<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that one cannot be a Christian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
without believing at least two miracles,
the virgin birth and the physical resurrection
of the Christ. Without comment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
on the significance of this retreat upon
the minimum of miracle, it must here
be noted that a minority of the Church,
not inferior to their brethren in learning
and piety, believe that there are no tides
in God's presence in Nature, that his contact
with it is always of the closest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 25em;">
<span class="i0">"Closer is he than breathing, and nearer than hands or feet."<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">All natural operations are to them divine
operations. "Nature," said Dr. Martineau,
"is God's mask, not his competitor."
While his agency in Nature may be <i>recognized</i>
at one time more than at another,
it <i>exists</i> at any time fully as much as at
any other. In the interest of this fundamental
truth of religion they affirm that
miracles in the traditional sense of the
word, and in their traditional limitation
to the small measure of time and space
covered by Biblical narratives, never
occurred. Events reputed miraculous have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
indeed occurred, but simply as unusual, inexplicable
phenomena in the natural order
of things, the natural products of exceptionally
endowed life, and, whether in
ancient time or modern, the same sort
of thing the world over. To the argument
that this involves denial of a supernatural
Revelation they reply that it is
mere reasoning in a circle. For if one
begs the question at the outset by defining
supernatural Revelation as revelation
necessarily evidenced by miraculous divine
intervention, then, of course, denial of
this is denial of that, and how is the
argument advanced? But, besides this,
the question-begging definition is a fallacious
confusing of the contents of the
Revelation with its concomitants, and of
its essentially spiritual character with
phenomena in the sphere of the senses.</p>

<p>The turning-point in this argument between
the two parties in the Church has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
been reached in the antipodal change,
already referred to, from the old to the
new apologetics,&mdash;a change whose inevitable
consequences do not yet seem to
be clearly discerned by either party in the
discussion. The contention that denial
of miracles as traditionally understood
carries denial of supernatural Revelation
has been virtually set aside, with its question-begging
definition and circular reasoning,
by the apologetics now current among
believers in at least a minimum of miracle
in the traditional sense of the word,&mdash;especially
in the two chief miracles of the
virgin birth and the physical resurrection
of Jesus. As an eminent representative
of these the late Dr. A. B. Bruce may be
cited. These adduce "the moral miracle,"
the sinlessness of Jesus, as evidential for
the reality of the physical miracles as its
"congruous accompaniments." "If," says
Dr. Bruce, "we receive Him as the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
moral miracle, we shall receive much more
for His sake."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> But what a turn-about
of the traditional argument on the evidences!
The older apologetes argued:
This crown of miraculous power bespeaks
the royal dignity of the wearer. The
modern apologete reasons: This royal
character must have a crown of miraculous
power corresponding with his moral
worth. In this antipodal reverse of Christian
thought it is quite plain that for
evidential purposes the miracle is stripped
of its ancient value. And it has already
been observed that modern knowledge has
now transferred many of the Biblical
miracles to the new rooms discovered for
them in the natural order of things. It
is not premature, therefore, for leaders
of Christian thought to put once more to
themselves the question, constantly recurring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as learning advances: What theological
readjustment should we have to
make, if obliged to concede that the ancient
belief in miracle is not inseparable
from belief in a supernatural Revelation,
not indispensable to belief therein? What
modified conception must we form, if constrained
to admit that the living God,
ever immanent in Nature, intervenes in
Nature no more at one time than another?
What, indeed, but a revised and
true in place of a mistaken conception
of the term <i>Supernatural</i>?</p>

</div><p class="p3"><span class="dcap">o</span> the true conception of the supernatural
we shall presently
come. But we cannot proceed
without briefly reminding ourselves of the
certain consequences of this now far advanced
dropping of miracles by modern
apologetics from their ancient use as evidences
of a supernatural Revelation. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
are not ignorant of the law, which holds
throughout the material, the mental, and
the moral realms, that disuse tends to
atrophy and extinction. Disused organs
cease to exist, as in the eyeless cave-fish.
For centuries the story of the miraculous
birth of Jesus was serviceable for confirmation
of his claim to be the Son of
God. In the address of the angel of the
annunciation to Mary that claim is expressly
rested on the miraculous conception
of "the holy thing."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But as ethical
enlightenment grows, the conviction grows
that, whether the physiological ground of
that claim be tenable or not, the ethical
ground of it is essentially higher. <i>Father</i>
and <i>son</i> even in human relationships are
terms of more than physiological import.
It is matter of frequent experience that,
where the ethical character of such relationship
is lacking, the physiological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
counts for nothing. Moreover, the divine
sonship of Jesus in a purely ethical view
rests on ground not only higher but incontestable.
And so in our time theologians
prefer to rest it on foundations that cannot
be shaken, on his moral oneness with
God, the divineness of his spirit, the ideal
perfectness of his life. The strength of
this position being realized, the world begins
to hear from Christian thinkers the
innovating affirmation that belief of the
miraculous birth can no longer be deemed
essential to Christianity; else it would not
have been left unmentioned in two of the
four Gospels, and in every extant Apostolic
letter. And now we hear theologians
saying: "I accept it, but I place it
no more among the evidences of Christianity.
I defend it, but cannot employ
it in the defence of supernatural Revelation."
Such a stage of thought is only
transitional. An antiquated argument<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
does not long survive in the world of
thought.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Military weapons that have
become unserviceable soon find their way
either to the museum or the foundry. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
is shortsighted not to foresee the inevitable
effect on our theological material of
the law of atrophy through disuse. The
case of the miracle is the case of a pillar
originally put in for the support of an
ancient roof. When the roof has a modern
truss put beneath it springing from
wall to wall, the pillar becomes an obstacle,
and is removed.</p>

<p>But as in such a case the roof, otherwise
supported, does not fall in when the
pillar is removed, so neither is the central
Christian truth of the incarnation imperilled
by any weakening or vanishing of belief
in the doctrine of the virgin birth. In
a discussion of the subject in Convocation
at York, England, while these pages
were being written, the Dean of Ripon
(Dr. Boyd Carpenter) urged that it must
be borne in mind that the incarnation
and the virgin birth were two different
things, and that some who found difficulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in the latter fully accepted the
former. In a recent sermon Dr. Briggs
insists likewise upon this: "The virgin
birth is only one of many statements of
the mode of incarnation.... The doctrine
of the incarnation does not depend
upon the virgin birth.... It is only a
minor matter connected with the incarnation,
and should have a subordinate
place in the doctrine.... At the same
time the virgin birth is a New Testament
doctrine, and we must give it its
proper place and importance.... The
favorite idea of the incarnation among
the people has ever been the simpler
one of the virgin birth, as in the Ave
Maria. The theologians have ever preferred
the more profound doctrine of the
Hymn of the Logos [John i. 1-18]."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Nay, it may even be found that the
weakening of belief in the incarnation
as an isolated and miraculous event may
tend to promote a profounder conception
of it, that brings the divine and the human
into touch and union at all points
instead of in one point.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p><p>A similar change of thought, less remarked
than its significance deserves, is
concerned with that other great miracle,
the corporeal resurrection of Jesus, which
such writers as Dr. Nicoll couple with
that of his virgin birth as the irreducible
minimum of miracle, belief in which
is essential to Christian discipleship.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
For many centuries the resurrection story
in the Gospels has served as the conclusive
proof both of the divine sonship
of Jesus,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and of our own resurrection
to immortality.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In the churches it is
still popularly regarded as the supreme,
sufficient, and indispensable fact required
for the basis of faith. But in many a
Christian mind the thought has dawned,
that a single fact cannot give adequate
ground for the general inference of a
universal principle; that a remote historical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
fact, however strongly attested,
can evince only what <i>has</i> taken place in
a given case, not what <i>will</i> or <i>must</i> occur
in other cases; while it is also inevitably
more or less pursued by critical doubt of
the attestations supporting it.</p>

<p>This rising tide of reflection has compelled
resort to higher ground, to the
inward evidences in the nature of mind
that are more secure from the doubt to
which all that is merely external and
historical is exposed. A clear distinction
has been discerned between the <i>real</i>
resurrection of Jesus&mdash;his rising from
the mortal state into the immortal, and
his <i>phenomenal</i> resurrection&mdash;the manifestations
of his change that are related
as having been objectively witnessed.
What took place in the invisible world&mdash;his
real resurrection&mdash;is now more
emphasized by Christian thinkers than
the phenomenal resurrection in the visible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
world. So conservatively orthodox
a writer as Dr. G. D. Boardman goes
so far as to say: "After all, the real
question in the matter of his resurrection
is not, 'Did Christ's body rise?' That
is but a subordinate, incidental issue."
The real question, as Dr. Boardman admits,
is, "Whether Jesus Christ himself
is risen, and is alive to-day."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The main
stress of Christian thought to-day is not
laid, as formerly, on the phenomena recorded
in the story of the resurrection,
but on the psychological, moral, and
rational evidences of a resurrection to
immortality that until recent times were
comparatively disregarded.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Meanwhile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the vindication of the reality of the phenomena
related of the risen Jesus, including
his bodily ascension, though not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
matter of indifference to many of those
who have found the higher grounds of
faith, has become to them of subordinate
importance.</p>

<p>It is well for Christian faith that its
supersensuous and impregnable grounds
have been occupied. It is certain that
ancient records of external phenomena
cannot in future constitute, as heretofore,
the stronghold of faith. But it is by no
means yet certain that they have lost
serviceableness as, at least, outworks of
the stronghold. While the doctrine of
the virgin birth seems to be threatened
by atrophy, the doctrine of the bodily
resurrection, though retired from primary
to secondary rank, seems to be waiting
rather for clarification by further knowledge.</p>

<p>Something of an objective nature certainly
lies at its basis; <i>something</i> of an
external sort, not the product of mere imagination,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
took place. To the fact thus
indefinitely stated, that hallowing of Sunday
as a day of sacred and joyful observance
which is coeval with the earliest
traditions, and antedates all records, is an
attestation as significant as any monumental
marble. No hallucination theory,
no gradual rise and growth of hope in the
minds of a reflective few, can account for
that solid primeval monument. But <i>what</i>
occurred, the reality in distinctness from
any legendary accretions, we shall be better
able to conclude, when the truth shall
have been threshed out concerning the
reality, at present strongly attested, and
as strongly controverted, of certain extraordinary
but occult psychical powers.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>A point of high significance for those
who would cultivate a religious faith not
liable to be affected by changes of intellectual
outlook or insight is, that this
lower valuation of miracle observable
among Christian thinkers has not been
reached through breaches made by sceptical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
doubts of the reality of a supernatural
Revelation. They have, of course, felt the
reasonableness of the difficulties with which
traditional opinions have been encumbered
by the advance of knowledge. But so far
from giving way thereupon to doubts of
the reality of divine Revelation, they have
sought and found less assailable defences
for their faith in it than those that sufficed
their fathers. And their satisfaction therewith
stands in no sympathy with those who
hold it a mark of enlightenment to assume
with Matthew Arnold, that "miracles do
not happen." It has resulted rather from
reaching the higher grounds of religious
thought, on which supernatural Revelation
is recognized in its essential character as
distinctively moral and spiritual.</p>

<p>The true supernatural is the <i>spiritual</i>,
not the miraculous, a higher order of
Nature, not a contradiction of Nature.
The Revelation of Jesus was altogether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
spiritual. It consisted in the ideas of God
which he communicated by his ministry
and teaching, by his character and life.
But this, the real supernatural, was not
obvious as such to his contemporaries.
They looked for it in the lower region of
physical effects. And here the Church
also in its embryonic spiritual life, in its
proneness to externalize religion in forms
of rite, and creed, and organization, has
thought to find it. Jesus' reproof, "Except
ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe,"
is still pertinent to those who will
not have it that the supernatural Revelation&mdash;spiritual
though it be&mdash;can be
recognized or believed in apart from an
acknowledgment of attendant miracles,
wrought in physical nature by an intervention
of God. Such a contention, however,
is as futile and desperate as was John
Wesley's declaration, "The giving up of
witchcraft is in effect the giving up of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Bible." Such mischievous fallacies succeed
only in blinding many a mind to the
real issue which the moral and spiritual
Revelation of Jesus makes with men of
the twentieth century. It is these fallacies,
and not their critics, that create the
most of scepticism.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>But while the question whether miracles
are credible has ceased to be of vital
importance, it has by no means lost all
importance. On the contrary, so long as
the path of progress is guided by the
lamp of experience, so long will it be of
consequence that the historical record of
experience be found trustworthy. It may
suit the overweening pride which defies
both the past and the present to say with
Bonaparte, that history is only a fable that
men have agreed to believe. But it is a
human interest, and a satisfaction of normal
minds to establish, so far as reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
permits, the credibility of every record
ostensibly historic. To discover that ancient
experiences, once supposed to be
miraculous raisings from real death, may
reasonably be classed with well attested
experiences of to-day, better understood as
resuscitations from a deathlike trance,
should be welcomed by unprejudiced historical
critics, as redeeming portions of
the ancient record from mistaken disparagement
as legendary. That further
study may accredit as facts, or at least as
founded on facts, some other marvels in
that record cannot, except by arrant dogmatism,
be pronounced improbable.
Nevertheless, it cannot be expected that
the legendary element, which both the
Old and the New Testament in greater
and less degree exhibit, can ever be eliminated.
Such stories as that of the origin
of languages at Babel, and that of the
resurrection of ancient saints at Jesus'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
resurrection are indubitable cases of it.
But the legendary element, though permanent,
is at present undefined. To define
it is the problem of the critical student, a
problem most difficult to him whose judgment
is least subjective; and he will welcome
every contribution that advancing
knowledge can supply.</p>

<p>Regarding miracle as the natural product
of exceptionally endowed life, there
is no source from which more light can be
shed on its Biblical record than in those
studies of the exceptional phenomena and
occult powers of life which are prosecuted
by the Society for Psychical Research,
whose results are recorded in its published
<i>Proceedings</i>. For those familiar with this
record the legendary element in the Bible
tends to shrink into smaller compass than
many critics assign it. In the interest
both of the Bible and of science it is
regrettable that the results of these researches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
though conducted by men of
high eminence in the scientific world, still
encounter the same hostile scepticism
even from some Christian believers that
Hume directed against the Biblical miracles.
Mr. Gladstone has put himself on
record against this philistinism, saying
that "psychical research is by far the most
important work that is being done in the
world." Were one disposed to prophesy,
very reasonable grounds could be produced
for the prediction that, great as
was the advance of the nineteenth century
in physical knowledge, the twentieth century
will witness an advance in psychical
knowledge equally great. In this advance
one may not unreasonably anticipate that
some, at least, of the Biblical miracles may
be relieved from the scepticism that now
widely discredits them.</p>

could not imagine Paul, Peter, and John all
ignoring something essential to the Gospel they
preached. Strictly speaking, this narrative in
Matthew and Luke was one of the latest touches
in the Gospel, belonging to a period forty or
fifty years after the Lord had passed away, when
men had begun to realize what he was&mdash;the
Son of God&mdash;and tried to express their conviction
in this form or that." The implication
here is unmistakable, that, in Dr. Horton's view,
subjective considerations in the minds of pious
believers, rather than objective fact, form the
basis of the story.</p></div>

protests of Dr. W. R. Nicoll: "To talk
of the resurrection of the spirit is preposterous.
The spirit does not die, and therefore
cannot rise.... The one resurrection of
which the New Testament knows, the one resurrection
which allows to language any meaning,
is the resurrection of the body, the resurrection
which leaves the grave empty" (<i>op. cit.</i>
p. 134).
</p><p>
It should be noted here that Jesus' argument
with the Sadducees on the resurrection
(Luke xx. 37, 38) logically proceeds on the assumption
that living after death and rising after
death are convertible terms. Also, that the
contrast involved in the idea of the resurrection
(the <i>anastasis</i>, or rising up) is a contrast not
between the grave and the sky, but between
the lower life of mortals and the higher life
immortal.

"census of hallucinations" conducted some ten

evinced the reality of veridical apparitions of
deceased persons at or near the time of their
death, showing the number of verified cases to
be so large as to exclude the supposition of
chance hallucination (see <i>Proceedings</i>, August,
1894). Or could it have been a material body
suddenly becoming visible in a closed room, as
narrated by Luke and John? First-class evidence,
if there can be any such for such occurrences,
has been exhibited for such phenomena
as the passage of solid substances through intervening
doors and walls&mdash;easy enough, say
mathematicians, for a being familiar with the
"fourth dimension"&mdash;and of the levitation of
heavy bodies without physical support. (See

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> Professor Borden P. Bowne has thus exhibited
this great mistake and its grievous consequence:&mdash;
</p><p>
"In popular thought, religious and irreligious
alike, the natural is supposed to be something
that runs itself without any internal guidance or
external interference. The supernatural, on the
other hand, if there be any such thing, is not
supposed to manifest itself through the natural,
but by means of portents, prodigies, interpositions,
departures from, or infractions of, natural
law in general. The realm of law belongs to
the natural, and the natural runs itself. Hence,
if we are to find anything supernatural, we must
look for it in the abnormal, the chaotic, the
lawless, or that which defies all reduction to
order that may be depended on. This notion
underlies the traditional debate between naturalism
and supernaturalism.... This unhappy
misconception of the relation of the natural to
the supernatural has practically led the great
body of uncritical thinkers into the grotesque
inversion of all reason&mdash;the more law and
order, the less God."&mdash;<i>Zion's Herald</i>, August

</div><p class="p3"><span class="dcap">t</span> remains finally to emphasize
the point of cardinal importance
in the considerations that have
been presented. This is not the reality of
miracles, but the reality of the supernatural,
what it really is, as distinct from
what it has been thought to be. The
advance of science and philosophy has
brought to the front this question: "Have
those who reject the claims of supernatural
Religion been misinformed as to
what it is?" Is it, as they have been told,
dependent for its attestation on signs and
wonders occurring in the sphere of the
senses? Does it require acceptance of
these, as well as of its teachings? Or is its
characteristic appeal wholly to the higher
nature of man, relying for its attestation
on the witness borne to it by this, rather
than by extraordinary phenomena presented
to the senses? There is at present
no intellectual interest of Christianity more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
urgent than this: to present to minds
imbued with modern learning the true
conception of the supernatural and of
supernatural Religion.</p>

<p>Miracles, legitimately viewed as the natural
product of extraordinary psychical
power, or, to phrase it otherwise, of an exceptional
vital endowment, belong not to
the Hebrew race alone, nor did they cease
when the last survivor of the Jewish apostles
of Christianity passed away at the end
of the first century. This traditional opinion
ought by this time to have been entombed
together with its long defunct
relative, which represented this globe as
the fixed centre of the revolving heavens.
Miracles have the same universality as
human life. Nor will their record be
closed till the evolution of life is complete.
Animal life, advancing through geologic
&aelig;ons to the advent of man, in him
reached its climax. Spiritual life, appearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in him as a new bud on an old stock, is
evidently far from its climax still. To
believe in miracles, as rightly understood,
is to believe in spirit and life, and in further
unfoldings of their still latent powers.</p>

<p>This, however, is just now of subordinate
importance. The present interest of chief
moment is a riddance of the hoary fallacy
that vitiates the current idea of a supernatural
Revelation by looking for its specific
characteristics to the physical world. By
this deplorable fallacy Christian theology
has blinded the minds of many scientific
men to the essential claims of Christianity,
with immense damage in the arrested
development of their religious nature
through the scepticism inevitably but
needlessly provoked by this great mistake.
When Elijah proclaims to idolaters that
their deity is no God, and, as we read,
corroborates his words by calling down
fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
it is reckoned as supernatural Revelation.
But it is not so reckoned when the sage in
the book of Proverbs proclaims to a nation
of religious formalists the moral character
of God: "To do righteousness and justice
is more acceptable to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> than sacrifice."
This is accounted as ethical teaching,
somewhat in advance of the times.
A pagan rather than a Christian way of
thinking is discoverable here. In each
of the cases cited the specific character of
supernatural Revelation is equally evident,&mdash;the
disclosure of spiritual truth above
the natural thought of the natural men to
whom it came. The character of any
revelation is determined by the character
of the truth made known, not by the drapery
of circumstances connected with the
making known. Clothes do not make the
man, though coarse or careless people may
think so. What belongs to the moral and
spiritual order is supernatural to what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
belongs to the material and physical
order.</p>

<p>This way of thinking will be forced on
common minds by thoughtful observation
of common things. Animate nature of
the lowest rank, as in the grass, is of a
higher natural order than inanimate nature
in the soil the grass springs from. Sentient
nature, as in the ox, is of a higher
order than the non-sentient in the grass.
Self-conscious and reflective nature in the
man is of a higher order than the selfless
and non-reflective nature in his beast of
burden. In the composite being of man
all these orders of nature coexist, and each
higher is supernatural to the nature below
it. Nature, the comprehensive term for
<i>all that comes into being</i>, is a hierarchy
of natures, rising rank above rank from
the lowest to the highest. The highest
nature known to us, supernatural to all
below it, can only be the moral nature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
whose full satisfaction is necessary to the
highest satisfaction of a man, and in whose
complete development only can be realized
in permanency his perfected welfare as a
social being.</p>

<p>Now it is precisely in the progress of
moral development that supernatural Religion
manifests itself as a reality. Religion,
indeed, is as natural to man as Art.
But there is religion and Religion, as
there is art and Art&mdash;the sexual religion
of the primitive Semites, the animistic religion
of China, the spiritual Religion that
flowered on the Mount of the Beatitudes,
embryonic religion and Religion adult;
all, indeed, natural, yet of lower and of
higher grade. Doubtless, Religion of whatever
grade outranks all other human activities
by its distinctive aspiration to transcend
the bounds of space and time and sense,
and to link the individual to the universal;
and so all Religion sounds, feebly or distinctly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the note of the supernatural. But
this is the resonant note of the spiritual
Religion which unfolds in the moral progress
of the world. As moral nature is
supernatural to the psychical and the physical,
so is its consummate bloom of spiritual
Religion to be ranked as such, relatively to
the religions which more or less dimly and
blindly are yearning and groping toward
the light that never was on sea or land.
Thus defining the word according to the
nature of the thing, supernatural Religion,
with its corollary of supernatural Revelation
not as an apparition from without,
but as an unfolding from within, is both a
fact and a factor in the development of
spiritual man.</p>

<p>The term <i>supernatural Religion</i> has
been rightly applied to that system of
religious conceptions, ideals, and motives,
whose effective culture of the moral nature
is attested historically by a moral development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
superior to the product of any other
known religion. Whether the greatest
saints of Christianity are all of them whiter
souls than any that can be found among
the disciples of any other religion, may
be matter for argument. There can be
no gainsaying the fact that, of great and
lowly together, no other religion shows so
many saints, or has so advanced the general
moral development in lands where
it is widely followed. But its essential
character has been obscured, its appeal
to man's highest nature foiled, and its
power lamed by the wretched fallacy that
has transferred its distinctive note of the
supernatural from its divine ideals to the
physical marvels embedded in the record
of its original promulgation, even conditioning
its validity and authority upon
their reality. Such is the false issue
which, to the discredit of Christianity,
theology has presented to science. Such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
is the confusion of ideas that in the light
of modern knowledge inevitably blocks
the way to a reasonable religious faith
in multitudes of minds thereby offended.
From this costly error Christian theology
at length shows signs that it is about to
extricate itself.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>As to the Christian miracles, there can
be no reasonable doubt that "mighty
works," deemed by many of his contemporaries
superhuman, were wrought
by Jesus. These, whatever they were,
must be regarded as the natural effluence
of a transcendently endowed life. Taking
place in the sphere of the senses, they
were <i>a</i> revelation of the type seen before
and since in the lives of wonder-workers
ancient and modern, in whom the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of mind over matter, however astonishing
and mysterious, is recognized as belonging
to the natural order of things no less than
the unexplored Antarctic belongs to the
globe. But <i>the</i> Revelation which he gave
to human thought as a new thing, a
heavenly vision unprecedented, was in
the higher realm of the moral and spiritual
life. This was the true supernatural,
whose reality and power are separable
from all its environment of circumstances,
and wholly independent thereof. The
characteristic ideals of Jesus, his profound
consciousness of God, his filial thought
of God, his saturation with the conviction
of his moral oneness with God,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> his realization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of brotherhood with the meanest
human being, still transcend the common
level of natural humanity even among his
disciples. As thus transcendent they are
supernatural still. Till reached and realized,
they manifest the fact of a supernatural
Revelation in that peerless life
as plainly as the sun is manifest in the
splendor of a cloudless day.</p>

<p>In the coming but distant age, when
man's spiritual nature, now so embryonic,
shall have become adult, it will doubtless
so pervade and rule the physical and psychical
natures which it inhabits that the
distinction between natural and supernatural,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
so important in the period of its
development, will become foreign alike to
thought and speech. But until the making
of man in the image of God is complete,
when the spiritual element in our
composite being, now struggling for development,
shall be manifest in its ultimate
maturity and ascendency as the distinctive
and proper nature of humanity, it is
of supreme importance for the Christian
teacher, who would point and urge to the
heights of being, to free men's minds of
error as to what the real supernatural is.
Not the fancied disturber of the world's ordered
harmonies, but that highest Nature
which is the moulder, the glory, and the
crown of all the lower.</p>

<p>Imaged to us in the human perfectness of
Jesus, the ideal Son of man, it is revealed
as the distinctive inheritance and prize of
the humanity that essays to think the
thoughts and walk the ways of God. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
each of us is it given in germ by our
human birth, to be fostered and nourished
in converse with the Infinite Presence
that inhabits all things, till its divine possibilities
appear in the ultimate "revealing

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> The words in which Jesus expresses this are
much more extraordinary and profoundly significant
than any of those mighty works of his,
the like of which are recorded of the ancient
prophets. Jesus was conscious of God as living
in him, and of himself as living in God, in the
unity of the one eternal life. Not merely as a
man <i>of</i> God, but as a man <i>in</i> God, as no other
man has consciously been, does Jesus utter
such sayings as, "I am the light of the world,"
"I and my Father are one." (See "Jesus the
Ideal Man," by the present writer. <i>The New
World</i>, June, 1897.)</p></div>

will, on request, send notice of the issue of each volume as it appears and
each descriptive circular sent out later; such requests for information

<p class="p4">The History of the Textual Criticism of the
New Testament</p>

<div class="bk3"><p class="p5">Prof. <span class="smcap">Marvin R. Vincent</span>, Professor of New Testament Exegesis,
Union Theological Seminary.</p>

<p class="rgt"><small>[<i>Now ready.</i></small></p></div>

<p class="p6"><small>Professor Vincent's contributions to the study of the New Testament rank him
among the first American exegetes. His most recent publication is "A Critical
and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistles to the Philippians and to Philemon"
(<i>International Critical Commentary</i>), which was preceded by a "Students'
New Testament Handbook," "Word Studies in the New Testament," and
others.</small></p>

<p class="p4">The History of the Higher Criticism of the
New Testament</p>

<div class="bk3"><p class="p5">Prof. <span class="smcap">Henry S. Nash</span>, Professor of New Testament Interpretation,
Cambridge Divinity School.</p>

<p class="rgt"><small>[<i>Now ready.</i></small></p></div>

<p class="p6"><small>Of Professor Nash's "Genesis of the Social Conscience," <i>The Outlook</i> said: "The
results of Professor Nash's ripe thought are presented in a luminous, compact,
and often epigrammatic style. The treatment is at once masterful and helpful,
and the book ought to be a quickening influence of the highest kind; it surely
will establish the fame of its author as a profound thinker, one from whom we
have a right to expect future inspiration of a kindred sort."</small></p>

<p class="p4">Introduction to the Books of the New Testament</p>

<div class="bk3"><p class="p5">Prof. B. <span class="smcap">Wisner Bacon</span>, Professor of New Testament Interpretation,
Yale University.</p>

<p class="rgt"><small>[<i>Now ready.</i></small></p></div>

<p class="p6"><small>Professor Bacon's works in the field of Old Testament criticism include "The
Triple Tradition of Exodus," and "The Genesis of Genesis," a study of the
documentary sources of the books of Moses. In the field of New Testament
study he has published a number of brilliant papers, the most recent of which is
"The Autobiography of Jesus," in the <i>American Journal of Theology</i>.</small></p>

<p class="p4">The History of New Testament Times in Palestine</p>

<div class="bk3"><p class="p5">Prof. <span class="smcap">Shailer Mathews</span>, Professor of New Testament History and
Interpretation, The University of Chicago.</p>

<p class="rgt"><small>[<i>Now ready.</i></small></p></div>

<p class="p6"><small><i>The Congregationalist</i> says of Prof. Shailer Mathews's recent work, "The Social
Teaching of Jesus": "Re-reading deepens the impression that the author is
scholarly, devout, awake to all modern thought, and yet conservative and pre-eminently
sane. If, after reading the chapters dealing with Jesus' attitude
toward man, society, the family, the state, and wealth, the reader will not agree
with us in this opinion, we greatly err as prophets."</small></p>

<p class="p4">The Life of Paul</p>

<p class="p5">Prof. <span class="smcap">Rush Rhees</span>, President of the University of Rochester.</p>

<p class="p6"><small>Professor Rhees is well known from his series of "Inductive Lessons" contributed
to the <i>Sunday School Times</i>. His "Outline of the Life of Paul," privately
printed, has had a flattering reception from New Testament scholars.</small></p>

<p class="p4">The History of the Apostolic Age</p>

<p class="p5">Dr. <span class="smcap">C. W. Votaw</span>, Instructor in New Testament Literature, The
University of Chicago.</p>

<p class="p6"><small>Of Dr. Votaw's "Inductive Study of the Founding of the Christian Church," <i>Modern
Church</i>, Edinburgh, says: "No fuller analysis of the later books of the New
Testament could be desired, and no better programme could be offered for their
study, than that afforded in the scheme of fifty lessons on the <i>Founding of the
Christian Church</i>, by Clyde W. Votaw. It is well adapted alike for practical
and more scholarly students of the Bible."</small></p>

<p class="p4">The Teaching of Jesus</p>

<div class="bk3"><p class="p5">Prof. <span class="smcap">George B. Stevens</span>, Professor of Systematic Theology, Yale
University.</p>

<p class="rgt"><small>[<i>Now ready.</i></small></p></div>

<p class="p6"><small>Professor Stevens's volumes upon "The Johannine Theology," "The Pauline Theology,"
as well as his recent volume on "The Theology of the New Testament,"
have made him probably the most prominent writer on biblical theology in
America. His new volume will be among the most important of his works.</small></p>

<p class="p4">The Biblical Theology of the New Testament</p>

<div class="bk3"><p class="p5">Prof. <span class="smcap">E. P. Gould</span>, Professor of New Testament Interpretation, Protestant
Episcopal Divinity School, Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="rgt"><small>[<i>Now ready.</i></small></p></div>

<p class="p6"><small>Professor Gould's Commentaries on the Gospel of Mark (in the <i>International Critical
Commentary</i>) and the Epistles to the Corinthians (in the <i>American Commentary</i>)
are critical and exegetical attempts to supply those elements which
are lacking in existing works of the same general aim and scope.</small></p>

<p class="p4">The History of Christian Literature until Eusebius</p>

<p class="p5">Prof. <span class="smcap">J. W. Platner</span>, Professor of Early Church History, Harvard
University.</p>

<p class="p6"><small>Professor Platner's work will not only treat the writings of the early Christian
writers, but will also treat of the history of the New Testament Canon.</small></p>
